/**
 * Sao's quest is about askintg the user for the number of values to sum
 * and then sum them all and provide the result as output.
 * 
 * Example: the user inputs "3", then the app asks 3 times for a number.
 * 
 * Question: Can I use a "while" loop to say: while the number of inputs is
 * not equal to numvalue, ask for numbers?

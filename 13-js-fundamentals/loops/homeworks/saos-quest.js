/**
 * Sao's quest is about askintg the user for the number of values to sum
 * and then sum them all and provide the result as output.
 * 
 * Example: the user inputs 3, then the app asks for the numbers
 * (and I want to ask 3 times, because that was what the user said).
 * Question: Can I use "while" to say : while the number of inputs is
 * not equal to numvalue, ask for numbers.
